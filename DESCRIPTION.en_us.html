    Oceane is a soft and slightly rounded typography with 3 styles: light, regular, bold, containing alternative glyphs for uppercase letters.
<br>
    Oceane is a fluid and organic typographic creation. Each curve and line is thoughtfully designed to write the silent language of our emotions and deepest thoughts, all expressed through a design imbued with gentleness.
<br>
Oceane is available in light, regular, and bold.
<br>
The typeface is characterized by its generous curves and rounded terminals, reminiscent of the perpetual motion of the waves, serving as an ode to the never-ending cycle of emotions, ideas, and of course, love.
<br>
Oceane's alternative glyphs offer creative versatility. These unique characters allow designers to take ownership of the font and weave tailor-made visual identities, suited to each project and vision.
